# NESSUS Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>üî¶Intro</h2>
As my first experience with a Vulnerability Scanner, I'd have to say this has been a very interesting and insightful experience but as with anything I try there will always be some hiccups. I'll delve into that later. I was able to complete this lab by using VMWare's Workstation Player, Windows 10 Virtual Machine and Tenables Nessus Vulnerability Scaner. This lab is not so much how to set up VMWare etc. but more so on my experience using the scanner. 

<h2>üî©Utlities Used</h2></br>

- VMWare Worksation Player 17
- Windows 10 Pro
- NESSUS Essentials

<h2>‚ôªÔ∏èThe Process</h2>

- First things first: installing Nessus. I had to install on my host system as I had critical issues trying to utilize it in VirtualBox's Windows 10 VM. [Nessus Essentials Download](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials).

- Once I had Nessus installed on my device, I began setting up Windows 10 on VMWare. It was a pretty straight forward process despite it being first time using VMWare's Workstation Player. I had to set the Network to NAT due to issues with Bridged and Host Only options not working in terms of internet access.

- I tried pinging the Windows 10 machine from my device but it could not connect due to the firewall. In the Windows 10 machine, I used the wf.msc command to open Windows Firewall settings and disable the firewall. Ping was successful.

- First scan (Basic Network Scan):The first scan was a basic network scan. Nessus provides various scan options and based on information that I Found, it is the most low level scan. For this scan, I only provided the scan name and the IP address of the Win 10 machine.
