# NESSUS Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>🔦 Intro</h2>
As my first experience with a Vulnerability Scanner, I'd have to say this has been a very interesting and insightful experience but as with anything I try there will always be some hiccups. I'll delve into that later. I was able to complete this lab by watching YouTuber Jason Madakor's Nessus tutorial which was very informative. This lab is not so much how to set up VMWare, Nessus and Windows 10 on the Virtual Machine. There are many resources and tutorials to assist with those steps. It will more so on my experience using the scanner and the results. Let's get into it..

<h2>🔩 Utlities Used</h2></br>

- VMWare Worksation Player 17
- Windows 10 Pro
- NESSUS Essentials

<h2>♻️ The Process</h2>

- First things first: installing Nessus. I had to install on my host system as I had critical issues trying to utilize it in VirtualBox's Windows 10 VM. [Nessus Essentials Download](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials).

- Once I had Nessus installed on my device, I began setting up Windows 10 on VMWare. It was a pretty straight forward process despite it being first time using VMWare's Workstation Player. I had to set the Network to NAT due to issues with Bridged and Host Only options not working in terms of internet access.

- I tried pinging the Windows 10 machine from my device but it could not connect due to the firewall. In the Windows 10 machine, I used the wf.msc command to open Windows Firewall settings and disable the firewall. Ping was successful.

- First scan (Basic Network Scan):The first scan was a basic network scan. Nessus provides various scan options and based on information that I Found, it is the most low level scan. For this scan, I only provided the scan name and the IP address of the Win 10 machine.

- Results of the first scan (Basic Network Scan):

- The results were bare minimum, more informational than things that needed immediate remediation so the next step was to try the credential scan. The credential scan in Nessus provided a more high level and in depth look at vulnerabilities within the system. I went a step further to install an old version of the Mozilla Firefox to increase the number of vulnerabilities that I would possibly see on my next scan.

- After installing the [old Firefox browser](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/), I went back to Nessus and updated the configuration. Basic scan only required the ISBN of the machine to run but credential scan requires the login information of the Windows 10 user.

- I went through and assessed the vulnerabilities and remediations. Firefox was the most criticial followed up by an old version of Internet Explorer that was still installed on the machine. The Windows 10 VM also needed updates to important services as well as apps.

- Remediations:
  - Firefox: Can either be upgraded or uninstalled. I decided to upgrade since I prefer Firefox to be on the machine.

 <h2>💭 Final Thoughts</h2>
 Nessus was an easier tool to use than I thought it would be. I found each vulnerability to be well detailed and the informational finds were insightful as well. I will be exploring it some more and may add additional finds here. I did have some hiccups in the beginning which I mentioned earlier. Story time... initially, I intended to set up Nessus on Kali linux but the first problem was that I could not click the Download button on the Nessus download page nor could I select the version for Nessus and the Linux OS version. I was able to finally download by copying the "curl" command for the file from my host system and paste it into the Kali CLI.

 After starting Nessus, I started the Windows 10 VM in Kali which sent my computer oer the edge in terms of utilization. The screen started going black and Kali crashed. In task manager running both said CPU and Memoery was at 100%. Even after adjusting the memory for Kali and Windows VM to the minimum required for Nessus usability in Windows, my computer would still crash 😓. I decided to install Nessus on my host system from there. Another issue I had was getting the Windows VM to connect to my network. All of the network adapter options such as Bridged and Host only would not work so I ended up using the NAT option. No big issue but an issue I never had with VirtualBox. All in all, I enjoyed working through this lab and seeing the results of vulnerabiity assesment and remediation.
