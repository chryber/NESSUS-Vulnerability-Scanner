# NESSUS Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>🔦Intro</h2>
As my first experience with a Vulnerability Scanner, I'd have to say this has been a very interesting and insightful experience but as with anything I try there will always be some hiccups. I'll delve into that later. I was able to complete this lab by using VMWare's Workstation Player, Windows 10 Virtual Machine and Tenables Nessus Vulnerability Scaner. This lab is not so much how to set up VMWare etc. but more so on my experience using the scanner. 

<h2>🔩Utlities Used</h2>
